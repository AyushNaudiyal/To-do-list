# Python Todo List Application

A simple Python-based Todo List application that lets you manage your tasks efficiently. The application uses a JSON file for data persistence and provides features like adding, updating, completing, and deleting tasks.

## Features

- **Add Todos:** Create tasks with a title, description, priority, and optional due date.
- **List Todos:** View all tasks, filter by completed or pending status.
- **Update Todos:** Modify task details, such as title, description, and priority.
- **Complete Todos:** Mark tasks as completed.
- **Delete Todos:** Remove tasks permanently.
- **Persistent Storage:** Todos are saved in a `todos.json` file for reuse.

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Basic knowledge of Python to run the script

---

   cd todo-list-app
   ```

2. Ensure Python is installed. Check the version with:

## Data Storage

The application stores todos in a file named `todos.json` in the same directory as the script. This ensures all tasks persist between program executions.

---

## Example

### Adding a Todo
```
Enter todo title: Buy groceries
Enter description (optional): Milk, eggs, bread
Enter priority (low/medium/high, default medium): high
Todo 'Buy groceries' added successfully!
```

### Listing Todos
```
--- Python Todo List ---
[ ] ID: 1 | Title: Buy groceries | Priority: high | Due: No due date
```

---

## Known Limitations

- **Concurrent Usage:** The application isn't designed for multiple users or concurrent sessions.
- **Due Date Validation:** Dates are stored as strings and not validated.
